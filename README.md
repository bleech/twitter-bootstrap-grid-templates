# Twitter Bootstrap Grid Templates

This trid template for the Twitter Bootstrap should help developers and designers to get together and makes it easier for the designers to understand what the developers will need in terms of materials, dimensions and sizes.

We're looking forward to improve the files and implement examples for several kind of websites so you and your clients can work together in a good workflow.

## You're a designer?

If you're a designer and need a good Template for the Twitter Bootstrap, check out our Grid Templates for Photoshop. It includes Photoshop templates and examples for all 4 default viewports and also shows where you should put your content and will help the most developers to get started with your layout pretty fast.

Check out the How-To to learn more about how to use this grid.

## What is still missing for now?

We still want to implement a few neat features for developers and designers but we're not sure how those features are going to look like.

If you want to help us in developing and improving a new workflow for designers and developers, you can help us with this project.
